It's an idiotic clone of well known
KScope project written in C with GTK+
support.

It's rather ugly as hell but does what I need,
so I decided to push it out in case someone need it
too.

Some ideas and icons are taken from KScope
as well (http://kscope.sourceforge.net/).

gscope is licensed under GPLv2 (some code
snippets even being really small still are
taken from linux kernel).
